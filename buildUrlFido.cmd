rem ===================================================================
rem buildUrlFido.cmd -- build urlFido.exe from urlFido.cs and the Homer C#
rem classes in C:\HomerDev.
rem
rem urlFido is a Windows console program with an Lbc dialog that drives the
rem system's Microsoft Edge over the DevTools protocol. This build is the
rem kit's C# template, Templates\build_APP_.cmd, with its SETTINGS filled in
rem for urlFido, plus one section of its own that carries over what the
rem layout before the kit left behind.
rem
rem IT KEEPS THE SAME CONTRACT AS THE PYTHON BUILD, buildUrlFidoPy.cmd,
rem clause for clause (kit 1.43.2):
rem   - finds the kit, and stops with a plain message when the kit is older
rem     than kitNeeded, telling a parse failure from an old kit;
rem   - version.txt is the single source of truth: stepped on every build
rem     (nobump keeps it), seeded when missing from the app's own number or
rem     one past its newest release tag, never from 1.0.0 over a released
rem     app, and written into Version.cs as BuildVersion.Version;
rem   - the program goes to exec\, as in the installed tree;
rem   - the kit's classes are NOT copied: each module named in homerModules
rem     is compiled straight from C:\HomerDev\CSharp, and a stale copy of a
rem     kit class at the top of the project is deleted once the kit's is here;
rem   - the compiler is Roslyn, found with vswhere or installed with winget
rem     as the free Build Tools. The Framework's own csc stops at C# 5 and
rem     cannot compile the kit, so it is never used;
rem   - the kit tools this app uses are refreshed into scripts\ and retired
rem     ones deleted, saying so when the kit lacks one;
rem   - documents: every .md at the top and in help\ gets its .htm when the
rem     .htm is missing or older; then fixEncoding puts every file the
rem     project names into the Homer encoding;
rem   - every file in help\ and every scripts\install*.cmd must be named by
rem     a Source: line of urlFido_setup.iss, or the build stops;
rem   - the installer is compiled with /DHomerDev=<kit>;
rem   - one log per run: logs\urlFido-build-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss.log. The console
rem     says briefly what is happening; the log holds every command and
rem     its exit code.
rem
rem   buildUrlFido          steps the version, then builds
rem   buildUrlFido nobump   keeps the current number
rem
rem A running copy of the program is never closed. The build says so and
rem stops only when the copy running is exec\urlFido.exe from THIS project,
rem which cannot be replaced while it runs; an installed copy under Program
rem Files is no concern of the build's.
rem
rem PARSE-TIME PITFALL: the variable NAME ProgramFiles(x86) contains
rem parentheses, and cmd.exe scans a parenthesised block for its closing
rem paren BEFORE expanding variables. The name is copied into progFiles86
rem outside any block, and only !progFiles86! is used inside one.

rem   exec   fetched and put beside the program in exec (the usual choice;

rem   (empty) not used
rem urlFido embeds it and its nvdaLoader extracts it to %LOCALAPPDATA%\urlFido
rem only when NVDA is running, so the program stays one file.
